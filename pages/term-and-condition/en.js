        <p>
          <strong>Derleng</strong>.biz and its subsidiaries (together "
          <strong>Derleng</strong>") provide an online platform with technology
          for Travelers, Members and Operators to meet online, enter contests,
          write reviews, search, compare and book tours, cruises and other types
          of activities ("Tours"). Tours are booked directly from the respective
          independent tour operator offering the Tour (each an “Operator”)/. The
          “Travelers” are travelers interested in booking a Tour. The “Members”
          are persons who completed <strong>Derleng</strong>'s account
          registration process. Travelers and Members are jointly referred to as
          “you”.
          <br />
          The “Services” comprise listings for Tours independently created by
          Operators in their own discretion and responsibility (each a
          “Listing”) as well as Content (as defined below) which are accessible
          at www.derleng.biz including its subpages (collectively, the "Site")
          and any related applications (the "Application").
          <strong>Derleng</strong> is solely acting as a commercial agent for
          the Operators. <strong>Derleng</strong> is not an operator of Tours,
          nor is it a provider of Tours, nor a representative or proxy of an
          Operator nor an insurer. <strong>Derleng</strong> does not own, sell,
          resell, furnish, provide, manage or control any transportation, tour
          or travel services and does not act as an agent to the Travelers.{" "}

          facilitating the availability of the Services and serving as the
          commercial agent of each Operator.

          Travelers, MEMBERS and other users of the Services. DERLENG CANNOT AND
          DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS OR THE
          CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY TOURS. DERLENG IS NEITHER
          RESPONSIBLE NOR LIABLE FOR TO ANY LISTINGS AND TOURS. BOOKINGS WITH

        <h3 className="mb-1 mt-4">6. Bookings and Payments</h3>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.1. Bookings by Travelers with Operators</h4>
        <p>
          The respective Operator only, and not <strong>Derleng</strong>, is
          solely responsible to the respective Traveler for honoring any
          confirmed bookings and making available any Tours reserved through the
          Services. The Operator is also responsible to provide all information
          legally required to the Traveler. If you, as a Traveler, choose to
          enter into a transaction with an Operator for the booking of a Tour,
          you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an
          agreement (including releases) with the Operator only and you agree to
          accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with
          such Tour imposed by the Operator and will receive necessary
          information from the Operator only.
          <br />
          You acknowledge and agree that <strong>Derleng</strong> is no party to
          the agreement but only acts as the commercial agent to the Operator
          and <strong>Derleng</strong> accepts no liability arising from or
          related to any of your agreements with the Operator unless{" "}
          <strong>Derleng</strong> is legally obliged to do so or to fulfil
          certain information and security obligations towards the Traveler.
          <br />
          The Operators are requested to either confirm or reject a booking
          within the specified timeframe (which is generally within 24 to 48
          hours of when the booking is requested, as determined by{" "}
          <strong>Derleng</strong> in its sole discretion) or the requested
          booking will be automatically cancelled.
          <br />
          Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete (including
          payment) you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your
          confirmed booking. The name and contact information of the operator
          will be available on the <strong>Derleng</strong> booking voucher.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.2. Payments by Travelers</h4>
        <p>
          You agree to pay for the “Total Cost” (including the price of the tour
          and, where applicable, taxes, levies and duties) for any booking
          requested, in accordance with the pricing terms set forth in the
          applicable booking page, if such requested bookings are confirmed by
          the applicable Operator. The availability and price of a Tour can
          change any time until you have received a booking confirmation.
          <br />
          In case only the deposit is payable at the time of booking or booking
          confirmation, the balance of payment (i.e., the Total Cost minus the
          deposit) is due and will be payable as stated in the Operator’s terms
          according to the booking page.
          <br />
          You agree to pay for the booking’s invoice to the operator or supplier
          by direct payment method or via <strong>Derleng</strong>’ payment
          method (through third party payment processors) as payment’s partners
          described on the checkout page. You agree to submit the payment slip
          to <strong>Derleng</strong> via Payment function in your{" "}
          <strong>Derleng</strong>’s account to verify your booking success and
          claim any benefit of reward or travel credit to your{" "}
          <strong>Derleng</strong>’s account.
          <strong>Derleng</strong> in its own discretion collects (through third
          party payment processors) the Total Cost (as one payment or deposit
          plus balance payments) for and on behalf of the Operator as its
          commercial agent. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts
          by charging the credit/debit card provided as part of requesting the
          booking, or by one of the other payment methods as described on the
          Site or Application.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.3. Bank and Credit Card Fees</h4>
        <p>
          Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for international
          transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the Cambodia
          credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local
          currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed
          on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency
          and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing
          summary page for a reservation booked on the Website or Application.
          In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank
          that issued your credit card is located outside of Cambodia. Booking
          international travel may be considered to be an international
          transaction by the bank or card company, since{" "}
          <strong>Derleng</strong> may pass on your payment to an international
          travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction
          fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the
          transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the
          exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.4. International Travel</h4>
        <p>
          By offering reservations for travel in particular international
          destinations, <strong>Derleng</strong> does not represent or warrant
          that travel to such areas is advisable or without risk.{" "}
          <strong>Derleng</strong> will not be liable for damages or losses that
          result from travel to such destinations.
          <br />
          You and any children traveling with you must be in possession of a
          machine-readable passport valid for 6 months after their trip return
          date along with applicable visas. It is your sole responsibility to
          secure and/or pay for any and all visas, reciprocity fees, affidavits,
          immunizations, etc. that are required to be permitted entry into each
          destination. In some countries you may be subject to entry
          (reciprocity) fees and/or departure taxes/exit fees which will be
          collected at the airports upon entry/departure by local government
          authorities. Please note that entry to any country may be refused even
          if the required information and travel documents are complete. For
          up-to-date detailed information on travel documents and visas,
          entry/exit taxes and further information on entry and exit
          requirements please check with your local consular services. Obtaining
          and carrying these documents is your sole responsibility.{" "}
          <strong>Derleng</strong> bears no responsibility for such information
          and will not be responsible for advising and/or obtaining required
          travel documentation for you, or for any delays, damages, and/or
          losses including missed portions of your vacation/holiday related to
          improper documentation or government decisions about entry.
          <br />
          Health: Recommended inoculations for travel may change and you should
          consult your doctor for current recommendations before you depart. It
          is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all health entry
          requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations, take all
          recommended medication, and follow all medical advice in relation to
          your trip.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.5. Traveler Cancellations and Refunds</h4>
        <p>
          - If the applicable Operator does not confirm the requested booking,
          or, as a Traveler, you cancel your requested booking before the
          requested booking is confirmed by an Operator, any amounts collected
          by <strong>Derleng</strong> or its third-party payment processor will
          be refunded to the Traveler within a commercially reasonable time,
          depending on the selections the Traveler made via the Site and
          Application, and any pre-authorization of such Traveler's credit/debit
          card will be released.
          <br />
          Once your booking is confirmed by the applicable Operator, the Total
          Cost of your Tour is subject to the cancellation and payment terms of
          the Operator. Please carefully read the fine print and important
          information in the Listing, the booking page and your reservation
          confirmation for policies as applied by the Operator. A cancellation
          must be done via your booking conversation page.
          <br />- If you are advised that your booking is on an 'on request'
          basis (which is typically the case for tours booked shortly prior to
          departure), the Total Cost of your Tour is subject to the cancellation
          and payment terms of the Operator from the moment when you have
          submitted the booking request. When a tour is 'on request' the
          Operator needs several business days to ensure that all of the
          components of the tour package can be confirmed for you. This process
          may not be interrupted by a request to cancel. So, if the request
          comes back approved you will be charged for the full amount, and if,
          as a Traveler, you cancel such a booking, this does not entitle you to
          any refund. If the Operator cannot confirm your request, you will
          receive a full refund.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.6. Operator Cancellations and Refunds</h4>
        <p>
          If an Operator cancels a confirmed booking made via the Services, a
          refund of the paid amount for such booking will be made to the
          applicable Traveler within a commercially reasonable time of the
          cancellation by the Operator and the Traveler may receive an email or
          other communication from <strong>Derleng</strong> containing
          non-binding suggestions for alternative Listings and other related
          information.
          <br />
          If you do not wish to accept the change, wherever possible the
          relevant service providers may offer you an alternative arrangement
          with an alteration in price or otherwise the booking will be cancelled
          subject to the cancellation policies mentioned on our website.
          <br />
          If an Operator cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Traveler,
          have not received an email or other communication from{" "}
          <strong>Derleng</strong>, please contact <strong>Derleng</strong> at
          info@derleng.biz.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.7. Changes you request or amend</h4>
        <p>
          Please note that it will not be possible to make any changes to a
          booking once confirmed unless the original booking is cancelled and a
          new booking made. Cancellation charges will apply.
          <br />
          Prices applying to all new bookings made following a cancellation will
          be those prices applicable on the day the new booking is made.
          <br />
          <strong>Derleng</strong> on behalf of its service providers reserves
          the right to cancel, change or substitute any service and to decline
          to accept or retain any tour members at any time for any reason
          including, without limitation, an insufficient number of participants.
          <br />
          Please check your booking details carefully to ensure that any other
          independent flight and/or travel arrangements coincide with the dates
          you have booked with us as we will not be liable for any costs
          incurred as a result of any mistakes by you.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.8. Special Requests</h4>
        <p>
          Please inform us at time of booking of any special requests for any
          service or facility that is not included as part of your booking. We
          will enquire with the relevant service provider and where possible
          will try to accommodate your request, but please note such requests
          cannot be guaranteed.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.9. Information Accuracy</h4>
        <p>
          We and our suppliers regularly review all details about the travel
          product offered to ensure accuracy. Please note all duration times
          given are approximate.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.10. Supplier’s Conditions</h4>
        <p>
          You are bound by the booking conditions of the relevant service
          provider and conditions of carriage where relevant and these
          conditions apply to your contract with us. In the event of any
          conflict between the conditions of the relevant service provider and
          our own, the relevant service provider’s conditions will prevail
          provided they are valid and enforceable, otherwise our conditions will
          prevail. The relevant service provider’s conditions may limit or
          exclude their and our liability to you and they may be subject to
          international conventions. Copies of the relevant parts of these terms
          and conditions are available on request from <strong>Derleng</strong>{" "}
          or the relevant service provider.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.11. Travel Insurance</h4>
        <p>
          It is a condition of our contract with you that you and all members of
          your party have suitable and sufficient travel insurance to cover your
          journey as neither <strong>Derleng</strong> nor our suppliers can be
          held responsible for any liability, expenses or losses you incur as a
          result of being inadequately insured. We strongly recommend that at
          the time of booking a comprehensive travel insurance policy is
          purchased.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mb-1 mt-4">6.12. Travel Voucher(s):</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Derleng</strong> will provide an electronic voucher
          (“E-Voucher”) in accordance with each service you have purchased.
          Please note that each product has a separate voucher and hence there
          could potentially be multiple vouchers for your booking. It is your
          responsibility to use your E-Voucher, you must print out your
